## Advent of Code 2024 in Rust

Taking a stab at this in rust this year.

Example run

```shell
cargo run -- <day> <part>
```

Generate new day:

```shell
#will prompt for day - just use english word. for example on day 10, use "ten"
make gen-day
```

<b>Note for self:</b>
On my personal machine, I'm storing this project in `/Users/<usr>/rust/code-advent-2024`.
